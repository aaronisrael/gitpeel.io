## ES6 Features

### Destructuring Assignment

This is really handy when you want to get an variable from an external source:

```
// before es6
const id = data.id;

// after es6
const {id} = data
```

### Template Literals

I use this a lot when preparing data to show to the user with extra text and variables

```
// before es6
return 'You are' + age + 'old'

// after es6
return `You are ${age} old`
```

### Spread operator

This is mostly used when you work with data that already exists and you want to exend or edit it.

```
// before es6
payload.age = 16;
payload.name = 'Aaron Israel'
payload.job = 'Front-end Engineer'

return payload;

// after es6
const extra = {
    age: 16,
    name: 'Aaron Israel',
    job: 'Front-end Engineer'
}

return {
  ...payload,
  ...extra
}
```
